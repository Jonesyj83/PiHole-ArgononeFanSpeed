# PiHole Argonone Fan Speed

I have create this addon for PiHole to display Fan Speed changes and CPU Temp. I am just doing this to teach myself some programming. Everything is working on my end. If there is better ways of doing this please let me know. 

The Graph will update only on changes with fan speed or if no speed has change in 1 hour, it will update to current speed/temp.
